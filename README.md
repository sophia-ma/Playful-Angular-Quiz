## Getting started
Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. I use Yarn to manage the dependencies, so I strongly recommend you to use it.

Install all dependencies (yarn/npm install)
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ and play!

### Building the project
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build.
